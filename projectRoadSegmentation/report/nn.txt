For this project,  the SegNet [1] architecture has been chosen which is a deep fully convolutional neural network . "The Segnet architecture consists of a sequence of non-linear processing layers (encoders) and
 a corresponding set of decoders followed by a pixelwise classifier. Typically, each encoder consists of one or more convolutional layers with batch normalisation and a ReLU non-linearity, followed by non-overlapping 
 maxpooling and sub-sampling."  The figure (x) shows the Segnet overall architecture.
Segmentation problems often use spatial softmax to try to classify each pixel. The Loss L used in SegNet is Basically a Spatial Multinomial Cross-Entropy that runs on each pixel of your output tensor, comparing 
with your label image. It is described as : (insert image).

The SegNet implementation in tensorflow was taken from github reference code [2]. Two version of SegNet has been used using the reference code, "connected" and "gate connected". Both version which takes as input
 for the Decoder the output of the previous convolver plus the output convolver of the corresponding Encoder part. 
 
The model using segnet has been trained with the augmented training set of N=7100 images and the corresponding label images the road (y=1) with a mini batch of 50 images. The initial learning rate is set to 0.001 
with a decay every 10000 steps.
