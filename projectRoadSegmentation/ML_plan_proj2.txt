16-23.11 Install scikit & tensorflow + play around + read 4 links in project2 description section "Guidelines for Machine Learning Projects"
23-30.11 Get a simple classifier working with cross validation (with scikit)
30-7.12 Focus on preprocessing
7-14.12 Find best classifier
14-21.12 write  (4 pages)

IDEAS for feature extraction:
- median filter     
- line hough transform
- harris corner
- Canny edge
- ridge detection
- for hough and ridge -> add direction or line
- distance to closest line
- distance to the 2 closes lines
- gradient

PREPROCESSING:
- Work on RGB or Gray (-> export rgb + gray images to see what they look like)
- morphological operators to merge lines
- blob detection


MODELS:
- SVM
